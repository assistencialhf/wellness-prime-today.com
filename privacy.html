We do not share information with third parties, however we do place Facebook and/or Google pixels
so that we can track the performance of our paid advertising.
This does not give us any personal information, but allows us to make better choices based on the
general trend.

How long we retain your personal information
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are stored indefinitely. This is so we can
recognize and approve any follow up comments automatically instead of keeping them in a moderation queue.
For people that register on our site (if any), we also keep the personal data they give us in their user
profile.
All users can see, edit, or erase their personal information at any time (except they cannot change
their username).
Website admin can also view and update those details.

What rights you have over your data
If you have a profile on this website, or have left comments (currently turned off), you may request to
obtain an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided
to us.
You can also request that we erase any private information we hold about you.
This excludes any information we are required to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
